# React webpack starter

A vaguely minimal [React](https://reactjs.org/) setup with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).

## Getting started

At the project root run:

```
npm i
npm run watch
```

The app is server by [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
which give hot reloading.
